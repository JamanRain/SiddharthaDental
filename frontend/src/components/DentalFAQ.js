  {
    question: "How often should I visit the dentist?",
    answer: "It is recommended to visit the dentist every 6-12 months for a routine check-up and cleaning.",
  },
  {
    question: "What causes tooth sensitivity?",
    answer: "Tooth sensitivity can be caused by enamel wear, exposed roots, or cavities. Using anti-sensitivity toothpaste can help in short term.",
  },
  {
    question: "How should I brush my teeth?",
    answer: "Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste. Brush in brisk and short strokes combined with horizontal and vertical motions near the gums for 3-4 minutes twice a day. Make sure you touch every surface of your teeth and also use dental floss for cleaning in between your teeth",
  },
  {
    question: "Whatâ€™s the best way to whiten my teeth?",
    answer: "Professional whitening by a dentist is the safest. Avoid over-the-counter strips unless recommended.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is flossing really necessary?",
    answer: "Yes, flossing removes plaque and food particles from between the teeth where a toothbrush can't reach, helping prevent gum disease and cavities.",
  },
  {
    question: "What causes bad breath?",
    answer: "Bad breath can result from poor oral hygiene, food particles stuck in the mouth, dry mouth, or underlying medical conditions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are electric toothbrushes better than manual ones?",
    answer: "Electric toothbrushes can be more effective at removing plaque, especially for people with limited dexterity, but manual brushing done properly works well too.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can diet affect my dental health?",
    answer: "Yes, sugary and acidic foods can increase risk of cavities and enamel erosion. A balanced diet supports healthy teeth and gums.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do if I have a toothache?",
    answer: "Rinse your mouth with warm water, gently floss to remove any stuck debris, and see a dentist promptly to diagnose the cause. You can apply clove oil as a home remedy",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I prevent gum disease?",
    answer: "Brush twice daily, floss daily, avoid tobacco, and visit your dentist regularly for cleanings and check-ups."
  },
   {
    question: "Why do my gums bleed while brushing or flossing?",
    answer: "Bleeding gums are usually a sign of plaque buildup or early gum disease (gingivitis). It can also result from brushing too hard or new flossing habits. If it continues, consult your dentistâ€”it may lead to more serious issues if left untreated.",
  }
